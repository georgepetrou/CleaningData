## Step 1
The x and y training data is read first using a default read.table call (the files are X_train.txt  and y_train.txt in the UCI HAR DataSet/train directory )

## Step 2
The x and y test data is then read using a default read.table call (the files are X_test.txt  and y_test.txt in the UCI HAR DataSet/test directory )
